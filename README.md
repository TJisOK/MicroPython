# MicroPython
## Snake 
### A project:

**1. handle a bit of i/o**  
- To learn MicroPython based on a game play rig

- To test raspberry pi running MicroPython  
<br>

**2. learn a bit of coding**
- How is uPy different from Arduino Environment  

- To understand how to play with lists and tuples in MicroPython    
To Pack and unpack tuple 
- To learn how to create a canvas on a ssd1306 128*64 OLED, with new resolution:
3x3_pixels as 1_new_pixel  
- To build a module in uPy for buttons control  
- To learn menu structure  
- ~~To build a none blocking buzzer feedback module~~

## bytearry_bitmap

### A file:
- helped me to learning the basic format of bytearray in micropython.  
  -  bytearray(), data = bytearray(8), data_read = data[0], data[0] = 0xFF 

- helped me to understand how to represent different number systems
  - 0b11111111, 0xFF, \xFF, b'0xFF', b'\xFF'

- helped me to Understand the binary representation of 1 bit pixel
  - through a group of dots
